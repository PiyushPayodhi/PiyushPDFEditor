Dear Investor,
Greetings from NSDL.
We are pleased to bring you NSDL Consolidated Account Statement (NSDL CAS). NSDL CAS is a single statement of all your
investments in the securities market. All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures,
securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in
this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder.
NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was
articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this
Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios.
As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance
policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). In case you do not have eIA,
please visit https://www.nir.ndml.in/ to open eIA online. We are now introducing additional feature of  Portfolio Value Trend whereby
you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new
fields viz., "Date of Birth" and "Aadhaar Number" under the section of "Know more about your accounts" in respect of your NSDL
demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of "Annualised Return" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information
pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.
I am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment
portfolio. You can easily monitor the investments you hold, their value and portfolio composition. It will help you in developing strategy
to manage your investments better. Further, we intend to bring you more features and services in the future. Please visit
https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com for more information. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on this initiative of NSDL.
Yours Sincerely,
G. V. Nageswara Rao
Managing Director & CEO

2018-08-15 18:21:15,183 INFO [1] Program -   
 
Dear Investor,
Greetings from NSDL.
We are pleased to bring you NSDL Consolidated Account Statement (NSDL CAS). NSDL CAS is a single statement of all your
investments in the securities market. All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures,
securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in
this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder.
NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was
articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this
Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios.
As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance
policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). In case you do not have eIA,
please visit https://www.nir.ndml.in/ to open eIA online. We are now introducing additional feature of  Portfolio Value Trend whereby
you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new
fields viz., "Date of Birth" and "Aadhaar Number" under the section of "Know more about your accounts" in respect of your NSDL
demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of "Annualised Return" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information
pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.
I am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment
portfolio. You can easily monitor the investments you hold, their value and portfolio composition. It will help you in developing strategy
to manage your investments better. Further, we intend to bring you more features and services in the future. Please visit
https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com for more information. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on this initiative of NSDL.
Yours Sincerely,
G. V. Nageswara Rao
Managing Director & CEO

Dear Investor,
Greetings from NSDL.
We are pleased to bring you NSDL Consolidated Account Statement (NSDL CAS). NSDL CAS is a single statement of all your
investments in the securities market. All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures,
securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in
this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder.
NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was
articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this
Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios.
As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance
policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). In case you do not have eIA,
please visit https://www.nir.ndml.in/ to open eIA online. We are now introducing additional feature of  Portfolio Value Trend whereby
you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new
fields viz., "Date of Birth" and "Aadhaar Number" under the section of "Know more about your accounts" in respect of your NSDL
demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of "Annualised Return" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information
pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.
I am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment
portfolio. You can easily monitor the investments you hold, their value and portfolio composition. It will help you in developing strategy
to manage your investments better. Further, we intend to bring you more features and services in the future. Please visit
https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com for more information. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on this initiative of NSDL.
Yours Sincerely,
G. V. Nageswara Rao
Managing Director & CEO

 Notes
(1) You will be receiving NSDL CAS on a monthly basis incase you have done any transaction(s) in your demat account(s) or in any of your Mutual Fund Folio(s). However,
if you have not done any transaction in any of your demat account(s) and Mutual Fund Folio(s) in last six months during April to September / October to March (i.e. dormant
demat accounts), then you will be receiving NSDL CAS with holding details on half yearly basis viz., NSDL CAS will be sent with holdings details as on March and
September end in the next month viz., April and October respectively.As directed by SEBI, since NSDL is providing the NSDL CAS, you may not receive statement from
your DP separately.
(2) The valuation of transaction/holding has been computed on the basis of the last closing price or NAV of the securities or units of mutual funds, as reported by Stock
Exchanges/AMFI/Mutual Fund/RTA. Where such price or NAVis not available, the last traded/available price or NAV has been taken into account and for unlisted securities,
face value has been considered. However, for securities listed at stock exchanges other than BSE and NSE (including de-listed securities), the last traded/available price
has been considered. Further, stock symbol is mentioned in NSDL CAS only in respect of  securities that are listed at NSE / BSE. Pursuant to amendments in Long Term
Capital Gain (LTCG) tax in Union Budget 2018, the value of holding for the month of January 2018 has been derived based on 'Fair market value' i.e. highest traded price
on NSE/BSE (as provided to NSDL) on January 31, 2018 in respect of listed Equity Shares/Equity Oriented Funds & ETF units. In case the listed Equity Shares/ Equity

Dear Investor,
Greetings from NSDL.
We are pleased to bring you NSDL Consolidated Account Statement (NSDL CAS). NSDL CAS is a single statement of all your
investments in the securities market. All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures,
securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in
this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder.
NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was
articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this
Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios.
As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance
policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). In case you do not have eIA,
please visit https://www.nir.ndml.in/ to open eIA online. We are now introducing additional feature of  Portfolio Value Trend whereby
you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new
fields viz., "Date of Birth" and "Aadhaar Number" under the section of "Know more about your accounts" in respect of your NSDL
demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of "Annualised Return" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information
pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.
I am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment
portfolio. You can easily monitor the investments you hold, their value and portfolio composition. It will help you in developing strategy
to manage your investments better. Further, we intend to bring you more features and services in the future. Please visit
https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com for more information. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on this initiative of NSDL.
Yours Sincerely,
G. V. Nageswara Rao
Managing Director & CEO
